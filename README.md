📏 Point-to-Point — Distance Calculator in Python

Ever needed to find the exact distance between two points without pulling out a calculator?
This Python script uses simple math to calculate it instantly.

💻 What's Inside

🖊 User Input Prompt → Enter coordinates for two points.

📐 Distance Formula → Implements √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²).

🛠 Handles Missing Points → Just type 0 if a value is unknown.

✨ Clean Output → Gives the distance with clarity.

🚀 Run It
python point_distance.py

📌 Example Output
If point value is none enter '0' 

Enter value of x1: 2
Enter value of x2: 5
Enter value of y1: 3
Enter value of y2: 7

The distance between two points is: 5.0
