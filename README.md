🌍✨ Whispers Between Two Points — A Nature’s Distance in Python ✨🌍
------------
🍃 Why This Isn’t Just Math

Every tree, every mountain, every star in the sky — all of them are points, scattered across the canvas of existence.
This script doesn’t just calculate the gap between numbers.
It listens to the silent song of nature,
measuring the invisible threads that connect us all.

When you enter two coordinates,
you’re not just solving geometry.
You’re tracing the path of rivers,
the flight of birds,
the space between two hearts under the same sky.

🌱 What’s Inside

🖊 User Input Prompt → Enter coordinates like planting seeds in earth.

📐 Distance Formula → √((x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²) — the quiet law that binds mountains to valleys.

🌾 Handles Missing Points → Type 0, and the earth still carries on, filling the silence.

✨ Clean Output → Returns the distance as if carved into the wind.

🌄 Example Run
If point value is none enter '0'

Enter value of x1: 2
Enter value of x2: 5
Enter value of y1: 3
Enter value of y2: 7

The distance between two points is: 5.0

This is not just a number.
It is the stretch of horizon from dawn to dusk.
It is the measure of how far two drops of rain land apart,
yet still belong to the same storm.

✨ Why You’ll Love It

Brings mathematics to life through nature’s lens.

Simple and pure, like sunlight filtering through leaves.

Perfect for learners who want geometry to feel like walking barefoot on earth.

🚀 Run It
python point_distance.py


Each run is not just a calculation.
It’s a meditation.
A reminder that in the vastness of space,
even two lonely points still share a distance.
